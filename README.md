# Teddy Critic
> A WordPress plugin replacement...

I just tweaked the ``hello.php`` plugin that comes in every release of
WordPress. Instead of Louis Armstrong's _Hello Dolly,_ I used Teddy
Roosevelt's _The Man in the Arena_ speech to pepper the backend dashboard
with timeless wisdom.


## Usage

Delete ``hello.php`` in ``wordpress/wp-content/plugins`` and replace it
with this (``teddy.php``). Then activate in the backend as you normally would.
